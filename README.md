AgriConnect - A Full-Stack MERN E-Farming Platform
AgriConnect is a comprehensive web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) designed to modernize the farm-to-consumer supply chain. It provides a digital marketplace where local farmers can showcase their products, and consumers can browse and discover fresh, local produce.

‚ú® Features
The application is structured around three distinct user experiences: the public visitor, the registered farmer, and the platform administrator.

üë®‚Äçüåæ For Farmers (Registered Users)
Secure Authentication: Full registration and login system with encrypted passwords and JWT-based session management.

Profile Management: A dedicated "My Profile" page where farmers can update their name, contact details, location, and upload a personal profile picture.

Farmer Dashboard: A private, professionally designed dashboard serving as the central hub for all farmer activities.

Full Product Management (CRUD):

Read: View a real-time list of all their own products.

Update: Edit the details of existing products via an interactive pop-up modal.

Advanced Communication System:

Low-Stock Alerts: Receive private, one-to-one notifications from the admin when product stock is low, visible on a dedicated "My Notifications" page and indicated by a real-time badge on the navbar.

Broadcast Management: A unified "Admin Requests" page to view public requests from the admin, reply to new requests, and see the "Viewed by Admin" status of past replies.

üëë For Administrators (Admin Role)
Secure Admin Dashboard: A private dashboard accessible only to users with the "admin" role.

Platform Overview: At-a-glance statistics for total farmers, total products, and low-stock items.
